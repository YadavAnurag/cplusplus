pointers

simple variables are allocated on stack
stack(very fast) has very limited amount of space....
if you want to store large amount of data use Heap(allocation is much slower)

stack - 
int x{3};
double y{100000};
string s{"anu"};


################################
Heap - using new
double* p = new double[10000000]; 

new -> request to Heap allocation
double -> element type
10000000 -> number of element count
double* -> type of pointing data type
p -> pointer to the beginning of allocated memory 
#################################
Note -> stack variables de-allocated when goes out of scope, but Heap variables not, so you must have to de-allocate them.

Heap allocation Steps
1. allocate big chunk of memory using new []
2. use the memory
3. must release it.
delete [] p;
or 
p = nullptr; // avoiding dangling reference
