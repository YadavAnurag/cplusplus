Another great course, Giovanni Dicanio, a great instructor, He is an Italian based instructor, anyone will like his tone.
From this course, I learned a lot, started with convenient syntactic sugar - like separators, literals, and automatic return type deduction.
c++11 improvements like constexpr, variable templates, deprecated attribute,
standard library improvements, lambdas(old type, generic lambdas and init-capture lambdas) and last 
with c++17 improvements, nested namespace, if and switch constexpr, structured bindings etc.
